			<h4>About</h4>
			<p>I'm a fourth year graduate student at Virginia Tech. I explore the dynamics of non-equilibrium systems as they harbor unexpected and even novel physical phenomena. Discerning the right physics in these complex systems is a challenging task, and I use modern theoretical methods and computer simulations to approach it. Currently, I am studying dynamical properties of inhomogeneous driven diffusive systems with attractive interactions, and investigating the depinning transition in magnetic skyrmions.</a></p>
